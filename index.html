        <p>JDLeds.com in conjunction with Lux Design LLC has designed a new direct replacement bulb for your late
            model John Deere garden tractor. These lights are designed to be 100% plug and play and are a direct
            replacement for your stock worn out bulbs. Designed to use its own integrated reflector, the light
            output is maximized by eliminating the outdated and often dirty stock reflector.</p>
        <p>Don’t be fooled by other brand LED’s that are a simple bulb replacement, the JDLeds are a full
            replacement system which include high quality heatsink and a full wiring harness replacement. Other
            brands wont share their lumen output so you don’t know how bright they are, and also other brand
            replacement bulbs aren’t designed to work in the stock reflector!</p>
        <p>Built 100% in the USA, these have been engineered to not only be brighter but also draw less power than
            the stock system. The light output of these is an eye pleasing natural 4500k color unlike the cold
            temperature of other LED bulbs. The natural 4500k white color reduces glare in rainy or misty conditions
            while appearing brightest to the eye. Here are the specs of the JDLEDs light system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>100% plug and play with no modifications</li>
            <li>Produces just under 2000 lumen of light, twice as bright as the stock bulbs.</li>
            <li>Consumes less than 1/3 the total power compared to the stock bulbs</li>
            <li>Rated for 50,000 hours of usage</li>
            <li>Fully CNC’d heatsink to allow for high driving currents</li>
            <li>Integrated optics for a far throw as well as a wide spread</li>
            <li>Most Efficient LED’s on the market for maximum output</li>
            <li>Warranty 1 year</li>
        </ul>
